# MozApkPublisher

Scripts to publish Firefox for Android on Google Play Store.

## Setup and run

1. Create a virtualenv and source it
1. `python setup.py develop`
1. Execute either `mozapkpublisher/get_apk.py`, or `mozapkpublisher/push_apk.py`, or `mozapkpublisher/update_apk_description.py`
1. Run `--help` to each of these script to know how to call them.

### Setup in Mac OSX


1. Install Xcode command line tools
   `xcode-select --install`
1. Create a virtualenv and source it
1. Some errors might happen during `python setup.py develop`
    1. fatal error: 'openssl/opensslv.h' file not found
        1. Temporarily adjust permissions on /usr/local so brew can update:  
            * `sudo chgrp -R admin /usr/local`  
            * `sudo chmod -R g+w /usr/local`
        2. Install the updated version of OpenSSL (you probably use 1.0.2j):  
            * `brew install openssl`  
        3. You may want/need to delete an existing symlink to openssl from /usr/local/bin:  
            * `rm /usr/local/bin/openssl`  
        4. Re-link the proper brew version:  
            * `sudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2i/bin/openssl /usr/local/bin/openssl`  
            * `sudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2j/include/openssl/ /usr/local/include/openssl`  
        5. Restore original permissions on /usr/local/bin:  
            * `sudo chown root:wheel /usr/local`  
1. Some errors might happen when executing `mozapkpublisher/push_apk.py`  
    1. You might have errors like  
        * Errors in from_p12_keyfile in oauth2client/service_account.py or
        * ImportError: cannot import name `_openssl_crypt`
            * `pip uninstall oauth2client`  
            * `pip install oauth2client==2.0.0`  
            * `pip install google-api-python-client==1.5.0`  
    1. Symbol not found: `_BIO_new_CMS`
        * `pip uninstall cryptography`  
        * `LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib" pip install cryptography --no-use-wheel`

> A guide to manually publish APKs onto Google Play Store

1. Generate a Google Play Store p12 certificate. This certificate needs to have write access to the app you want to publish. In this context, "app" means Fennec, Fennec Beta or Fennec Aurora.
1. Execute the steps defined in the section above.
1. Download the latest signed builds. For instance, for Fennec Aurora:
  * ARM apk:  https://tools.taskcluster.net/index/artifacts/#gecko.v2.mozilla-aurora.signed-nightly.nightly.latest.mobile/gecko.v2.mozilla-aurora.signed-nightly.nightly.latest.mobile.android-api-15-opt
  * x86 APK:  https://tools.taskcluster.net/index/artifacts/#gecko.v2.mozilla-aurora.signed-nightly.nightly.latest.mobile/gecko.v2.mozilla-aurora.signed-nightly.nightly.latest.mobile.android-x86-opt
1. `./mozapkpublisher/push_apk.py --package-name org.mozilla.fennec_aurora --track beta --credentials /path/to/your/googleplay/creds.p12 --service-account your-service-account@boxwood-axon-825.iam.gserviceaccount.com --apk-x86 x86.apk  --apk-armv7-v15 arm.apk --dry-run`
  * Note the `--dry-run` option. This will do everything needed, but commit the transaction.
  * Even though we're publishing aurora, we use the "beta" track on Google Play, that's our way to show to people on Play Store that it's not a finished product. We don't use the "production" track for aurora, unlike beta and release.
1. Run the above command, but without `--dry-run`
